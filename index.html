                <h2>Hi I'm Martin!</h2>
                <p>Hi, My name is Martin and I'm an aspiring front end developer!
                     I recently found out about web development and thought I would give it a go. 
                     I certainly did not think I would enjoy it this much! I now love coding. The challenge, the creativity, 
                     the design, and the reward it brings are reasons why I'm drawn to the web developer world. 
                     I love learning new things and I'm excited to become a master in web development. </p>

                <h2>My Dream</h2>
                <p>My dream is to work for a progressive company and to learn and gain insights from knowledgeable people.
                     I’m excited to kickstart my career as web developer and immerse myself in something I’m very passionate about.
                      I see myself fitting in well in the developer work environment and I'm excited to get some hands on practice.</p>

            <div class="secTwoColOne">
                <p>My current skills consist of HTML and CSS, with basic JavaScript 
                    (objects, arrays, loops, if statements, variables, the DOM and more) as well as some ES6. 
                    I also have experience with bootstrap, googlefonts and Mailchimp. I love researching and finding solutions on my own using 
                    trial and error and also utilising resources such as stackoverflow, w3schools and MDN web docs. 
                    I am continuing to build on my skills through various tutorials such as The Complete Web Developer Zero To Mastery 
                    course by Andrei Neagoie on Udemy and The FrontEnd Developer Career Path on Scrimba. 
                    My goal upon completion of these courses is to become proficient at Advanced Javascript, React, API's and maybe a bit of backend.</p>

                <p>My Projects consist of a few mock up websites I made with my newfound HTML and CSS skills as well as a couple Javascript Projects. 
                    One of the JS projects is a simple To-Do list which I plan to make responsive and more complex, another is a Memory Card Game I am currently working on which
                    has been very fun and satisfying to make so far as I am doing it from scratch on my own (with a little help from stackoverflow). With each project I feel myself 
                    becoming a better developer and I plan to continue doing more and more complex projects to improve my skills. Please feel free to check out my projects and code on my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/MartinMordaunt" class="click">MartinMordaunt.</a>
